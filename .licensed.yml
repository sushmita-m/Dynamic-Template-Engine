# These dependencies are ignored during enumeration.

# This configuration is intended to be used for dependencies that don't need to
# be included for compliance purposes, such as other projects owned by the current
# project's owner, internal dependencies, and dependencies that aren't shipped with
# the project like test frameworks.
# ignored:

# These dependencies have licenses not on the `allowed` list and have been reviewed.
# They will be cached and checked, but will not raise errors or warnings for a
# non-allowed license.  Dependencies on this list will still raise errors if
